# 🏢 Nexus HR – Full‑Stack HR & Payroll SaaS Platform

> **Production‑ready workforce management system built to demonstrate real‑world SaaS architecture, business logic, and scalable full‑stack development.**

Nexus HR is a complete Human Resources & Payroll management platform designed for small to medium‑sized organizations. It goes beyond CRUD operations by implementing real business rules, secure authentication, and relational data integrity, similar to what real clients require in production systems.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters (Client Perspective)
This project demonstrates my ability to:
* **Design and build** end‑to‑end SaaS applications.
* **Translate business requirements** into reliable software logic.
* **Develop secure, scalable**, API‑driven systems.
* **Deliver clean, responsive**, role‑based user interfaces.

It reflects the type of systems I build for clients: dashboards, internal tools, and SaaS platforms.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview
Nexus HR follows a decoupled full‑stack architecture, allowing the frontend and backend to scale independently.

* **Frontend:** React SPA consuming REST APIs.
* **Backend:** Django REST Framework handling business logic.
* **Authentication:** JWT‑based with secure token refresh handling.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL enforcing relational integrity.

---

## 🔌 API Architecture: Dual-Protocol Support
Nexus HR implements a hybrid API strategy to demonstrate versatility and performance optimization:

### **1. REST API (Standard)**
* **Use Case:** Web Dashboard & legacy integrations.
* **Tech:** Django Rest Framework (DRF).
* **Endpoints:** Standard CRUD for Employees, Payroll, and Leave.

### **2. GraphQL API (Feature Branch)**
* *Available in the `v2-graphql-api` branch.*
* **Use Case:** Mobile clients & complex data fetching.
* **Tech:** Graphene-Django.
* **Key Capabilities:**
    * **No Over-fetching:** Clients request *only* the specific fields they need.
    * **Nested Queries:** Fetches Employee profile + Payroll History in a **single request**.
    * **Mutations:** Type-safe data creation.
